# Project: 
### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

In addition to the original data provided for the project, I have also used in the project a spreadsheet of word categories from the General Inquirer database (inquirerbasic.csv) (http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~inquirer/homecat.htm).
