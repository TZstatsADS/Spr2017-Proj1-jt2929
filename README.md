### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2017

+ Projec title: Off with the Old, On with the New? - A story of how inauguration speeches can shed some light on the evolution of the American society over time, and what remains rooted
+ This project is conducted by Jia Hui Tan

+ Project summary: [a short summary] 

Presidential inaugural addresses mark the beginning of a new era of leadership. These addresses serve to dignify the nation and its values,to unite a deeply divded electorate, and to give a sense of direction and continuity. Some speeches have been serviceable, some forgettable, and some remembered till today. 

But inauguration speeches can provide more information and insights than just memorable and iconic quotes. A more focused and deeper analysis of these speeches over time could be highly illuminating and could provide some reflections on how the American society has evolved over time. While these addresses are still rooted to certain traditional expectations, purpose, and norms, they each also bear signs to the time in which it was written and delivered.

A variety of tools will be used in this notebook (but mainly natural text processing and text mining) to present some interesting angles, using the Inaugaration Speeches from George Washington in 1789 to the latest 2017 speech by Donald Trump. I will first present elements of inauguration speeches that have remained constant over time, and then proceed on to elements that have evolved, and what these patterns suggest about the evolution of the American society. In particular, I will focus on the political and social aspects of the American society.
